# Healers Project: Interview Collection DMP
Collection description

## Roles & Responsibilities
The DMP should clearly articulate how sharing of primary data is to be implemented.  It should outline the rights and obligations of all parties with respect to their roles and responsibilities in the management and retention of research data. It should also consider changes to roles and responsibilities that will occur if a project director or co-project director leaves the institution or project. Any costs stemming from the management of data should be explained in the budget notes.

The Healers interview collection consists of audio clips of interviews, as well as accompanying transcripts and translations, conducted through years of fieldwork throughout the Caribbean and the Pacific Northwest. These interviews broadly address the question: What does healing look like in the context of Afro-indigenous traditions? The interview collection will be shared with the general public using the University of Oregon’s cultural heritage digital library, Oregon Digital. It will also be deposited into the Digital Library of the Caribbean at the University of Florida. We are taking a multi-institutional approach to having the collection in both digital repositories because we believe in LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe). However, the authoritative interviews will be held by the University of Oregon and aggregated through the Digital Library of the Caribbean not the University of Oregon.

- **Claire Matucan**, *Project Manager*, Claire Matucan has taken the role of Project Manager. As Project Manager, Claire helps coordinate group work and progress for the digital collection by overseeing group communication via Teams, schedules, and initiates group meetings online and in person. Additionally, she ensures the quality of work submitted by the group for the digital collection. As Project Manager, she also submits group work on behalf of the team. 
- **Daveena Williams**, *Metadata manager*, In this project Daveena Williams was our Metadata manager which includes facilitating object cataloging within our digital archive. Ensuring all objects follow the project’s metadata application profile. She also was in charge of metadata quality review; making final decisions about how objects are described and standardizing all data entry based on CollectionBuilder’s metadata requirements. 
- **Regan Robinson**, *Object Preservation Manager*, Regan Robinson took on the role of Object Preservation Manager for this project. She is responsible for overseeing the organization of the digital files the group is working with and maintaining the readability of the file naming standards. Once CollectionBuilder is introduced, she will also manage the objects that will enter the collection based on their format and the format requirements set by CollectionBuilder.
- **Jackson Scharf**, *Collection Development Manager,* As Collection Development Manager, Jackson Scharf, at this point in the project, has been responsible for the evaluation of file formats and copyright and licensing. It should be noted that the Collection Development Manager will also later be responsible for the evaluation, and final selection of objects in the collection, as well as a written description of the collection. For now, however, Jackson has mostly been working to ensure that we are obeying US copyright law, and are appropriately labeling our objects with the proper rights statements.  


## Expected Data
**The DMP should describe the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, or other materials to be produced during the project. It should then describe the expected types of data to be retained.**

Project directors should address matters such as these in the DMP:
- the types of data that their project might generate and eventually share with others, and under what conditions;
- how data will be managed and maintained until shared with others;
- factors that might impinge on their ability to manage data, for example, legal and ethical restrictions on access to non-aggregated data;
- the lowest level of aggregated data that project directors might share with others in the scholarly or scientific community, given that community's norms on data;
- the mechanism for sharing data and/or making it accessible to others; and
- other types of information that should be maintained and shared regarding data, for example, the way it was generated, analytical and procedural information, and the metadata.
### Data types
There will be a minimum of 20 interviews in this digital collection. The interviews that will be published on the web include audio (.mp3) and transcription and translation documents (.pdfs). 

**Data quantity**: As of spring 2023, there are 20 interviews. These interviews are clips from longer ones. It is important to note that the collection will grow as more interviews are added. This means for every interview in the collection, data managers need also count the transcription and translation. So, if there are 20 interview clips then there are 20 transcriptions and 20 translations, which makes the collection contact 60 files. 

Here is a breakdown of collection size, work type, file format, total number of assets, average file size, and average total size for a set of file types.
