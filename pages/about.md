# Our Collection:
*Asian Heritage in Oregon Throughout History* is a digital thematic collection created by **Regan Robinson, Daveena Williams, Jackson Scharf, and Claire Matucan.** Our digital collection focuses on the immigration of Asian populations to Oregon from 1850 to 1980, with a focus on primary sources to help narrate the important and complex story of Asian immigration during a century of turmoil for these populations in America. Included in our collection are photographs, letters, artifacts, art, legal documents, newspaper articles, and more to formulate a thematic and chronological history of these vast and diverse populations within Oregon. We consciously chose to focus on a more broad population as we feel it’s important to acknowledge the histories of all Asian communities as important historical events rooted in racism and xenophobia had massive effects on Asian populations in particular. We seek to shed light on these events and their impacts on the work and lives of the populations in which we are researching. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act was an extremely important event impacting Asian communities in Oregon and internationally. The act initiated an absolute 10-year ban on immigrants coming from China, despite this, the act has had massive impacts on all Asian immigrants due to racism and prejudice that targeted all Asian populations. With this project, we hope to shed light on these underrepresented populations and their contributions to culture and the overall development of Oregon as many of the Asian immigrants that arrived here worked in mines, factories, and assisted in the growth of cities across the state.
